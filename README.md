Summary:
It is at the heart of the command/control room and provides all the teams with valuable information EARLY in the design & build process and more importantly during the competition.

It allows multiple instances to run on different/same machine(s). It also allows multiple Lunabots to be monitored simulatneously. In addition, you can select the communcation interface between Wifi and Wired Ethernet depending on your needs. (Please see Communications Tab for Details.)

Organisation of Information:
The overview window allows the key parameters to be monitored at a glance. Further, the Team Specific Tabs allow detailed supervision of parameters related to a perticular team. This means, each team can request the variables they would like to monitor during the design/build phase and during the competition.
